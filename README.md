# Weatherr App
For every developer it always seems to be a checklist for projects. This is one of them.

## Introduction
Its a really simple weather app created by react and Api from https://openweathermap.org/ to give the weather data. It displays mainly four aspects:

### Town
The place is first on the list
### Temprature
This is the temprature of the searched town. It has been highlighted in degrees celcius(°) and has been rounded to the nearest number.
### Weather
This indicates the current weather conditions ranging from sunny to rainy.
### Humidity
Thisindicates the humidity of the searched area.

## Features
This weather app has a search feature with many towns being easily searched and weather data being found.
In this project i used axios as a fetch to try and learbn how to leverage it in my future projects.


## Deployment
The app was successfully deployed and is live on render.
